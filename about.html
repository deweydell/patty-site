  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>As far back as I can remember I’ve been doodling, drawing, painting, printmaking and doing graphic design. Sometimes with more focus, sometimes when life overtakes me, just sketching in a small book at the beach, in the park or inside. Also, I work slowly. Now, I have the time and a little bit of space to concentrate on my painting. I’m learning to work outside which is a very different experience &mdash; I like the time limit &mdash; to get it down before the light disappears.</p>
